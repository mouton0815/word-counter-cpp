Some observations:
* With version 11, C++ became an even more complex beast than it had already been with older versions.
There are lot's of new and mostly *good* features that make the code more concise and programs safer.
But since all old stuff remains, C++ is much harder to learn than other languages, especially Go. 
* In contrast to Go or Java, the C++ standard library does not provide a blocking queue.
